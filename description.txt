[h1]Automation & Defense[/h1]

As a big fan of automation, I have decided to make my first tech mod for Terraria. Lots of items are heavily inspired by [url=https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create]Create Mod[/url] in Minecraft, you should check it out.

Before I start, I have to say I am not good at creating pixel arts so lots of sprites are modified directly from [url=https://foozlecc.itch.io/]Foozle[/url]. Their arts are free to use and distribute, please give them support if you feel like it.

I do not take donations. If you want to support, donate to any charity of your choice, or any of the creators I mentioned above.

Now let's get into it.

[h2]Transportation System[/h2]
[h3]Item Transporter[/h3]
Transports items around like a pipe system. Can be connected to Funnel for extracting/inserting, and Splitter/Merger.

[h3]Item Funnel[/h3]
Acts as both an extractor and inserter, mode depends on the direction of the connected Transporter. Can only interact with chests.

Filter can be set for extracting mode.

[h3]Splitter & Merger[/h3]
Two items in one. Can split and merge at the same time. 

For outgoing direction:
If a filter is set, the item will proritize the directions with matching filter, otherwise it will be split evenly in all directions.

[h2]Automation System[/h2]
[h3]Stone Generator[/h3]
Generates stone blocks indefinitely, outputs to a chest next to it.

[h3]Ore Extractor[/h3]
Extract ores (...by magic) from stone blocks. 

Requires: Pickaxe (pickpower decides which ores can be extracted), input chest with stone blocks, output chest to store ores.

Filter can be set so only a specific ore is extracted. Otherwise, all ores are extracted randomly (1% chance per stone block).

[h3]Auto Crafter[/h3]
Craft items periodically.

Requires: an Item for recipe, related crafting stations, input chest with ingredients, output chest to store crafted items.

Items with near water/honey/lava conditions are free to craft. Items that require Demon Altar are not supported (unless you have another mod which adds an item to place altars, but I have not tested)

[h3]Wood Harvester[/h3]
Extracts woods and sends to the Wood Harvester Base at the bottom. Can stack on top of each other to make a looong line.

[h3]Wood Harvester Base[/h3]
Stores woods from Harvesters above it. Sends woods to a chest next to it.

[h3]Item Vacuum[/h3]
Collects items around it and puts them in chests on either side
Radius can be increased/decreased

[h2]Defense System[/h2]
[h3]Magic Tower[/h3]
Automatically pull bullets in chests next to it to shoot at nearby enemies. Moderate speed and low damage.

New recipe added for Musket Ball (requires any iron bars) so most bullets in the game can be automated using Auto Crafter.

[h2]Final words[/h2]
This does NOT work in multiplayer. I just simply don't have enough time to try. If you want to help, leave a comment.

If you find any bug, leave a screenshot or a description (what's in the filter, what's the setup like, which items, etc.) and I will have a look.

If you have any idea for new machines, let me know, and if you also provide the arts for it I'll make it.

The mod is by nature very OP because Terraria doesn't need any automation. With enough grinding, you can probably set up an infinite ore generation and insta kill any boss with lots of towers.
