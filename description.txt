[h1]Automation & Defense[/h1]
[quote=tModLoader]Developed By SirKoral[/quote]

As a big fan of automation, I have decided to make my first tech mod for Terraria. Lots of items are heavily inspired by [url=https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create]Create Mod[/url] in Minecraft, you should check it out.

Before I start, I have to say I am not good at creating pixel arts so lots of sprites are modified directly from [url=https://foozlecc.itch.io/]Foozle[/url]. Their arts are free to use and distribute, please give them support if you feel like it.

Now let's get into it.

[h2]Transportation System[/h2]
[h3]Item Transporter[/h3]
The main component of this mod. It transports items around like conveyor belts, like a pipe system. However, it doesn't work by itself, it needs to be connected to other components.

[h3]Item Funnel[/h3]
Acts as both an extractor and inserter. Whether it extracts or inserts depends on the direction of the Item Transporter connected to it. Can only interact with chests.

[h3]Splitter & Merger[/h3]
Two items in one. Can split and merge at the same time. 

For outgoing direction:
If a filter is set, the item will proritize the directions with matching filter, otherwise it will be split evenly in all directions.

[h2]Automation System[/h2]
[h3]Stone Generator[/h3]
Generates stone blocks indefinitely, outputs to a chest next to it.

[h3]Ore Extractor[/h3]
Extract ores (...by magic) from stone blocks. 
To make sure it's not too OP, the chance is very low (1% per block) and it needs a lot of ingredients to craft.
A pickaxe must be set to start the machine. The pickaxe's power decides which ores can be extracted, they are all extracted randomly. A filter can be set so only a specific ore can be extracted (if pickaxe's power is sufficient).
Supports all vanilla ores including Meteorite and Obsidian, but not Luminite. 

Input and output chests on the side are also needed.

[h3]Auto Crafter[/h3]
Provided with an item, and the required crafting stations, it will craft the item periodically. For items with no crafting stations, but with conditions (near honey, lava, etc.) are free to craft. Items that require Demon Altar are not supported (unless you have another mod which adds an item that can place these altars, but I have not tested)

Input and output chests on the side are also needed.

[h2]Defense System[/h2]
[h3]Magic Tower[/h3]
Automatically pull bullets in chests next to it to shoot at nearby enemies. Moderate speed and low damage.

New recipe added for Musket Ball (requires any iron bars) so most bullets in the game can be automated using Auto Crafter.

[h2]Final words[/h2]
This does NOT work in multiplayer. I just simply don't have enough time to try. If you want to help, leave a comment.

If you find any bug, leave a screenshot or a description (what's in the filter, what's the setup like, which items, etc.) and I will have a look.

If you have any idea for new machines, let me know, and if you also provide the arts for it I'll make it.

The mod is by nature very OP because Terraria doesn't need any automation. With enough grinding, you can probably set up an infinite ore generation and insta kill any boss with lots of towers.
